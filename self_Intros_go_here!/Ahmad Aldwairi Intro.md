Hi everyone! My name is Ahmad Aldwairi, and I am currently in my last term of the Computer Science (C++) program.
My previous education was a Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management. I decided to pivot to computer science because, from a young age, I loved video games and was often more interested in modifying and exploring how they worked than simply playing them. This led me to pursue software development. 

I am particularly interested in game development and 3D modeling. I have been working with Unreal Engine for about two and a half years and currently contribute as a C++ programer to the community project "Battle for Middle-earth: Reforged". I am also a student at ThinkTank Centre in Canada, where I am studying 3D Asset Creation for Games. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and watching soccer, going to the gym, and working on personal projects. After completing this semester, I plan to move to Buffalo, NY, to continue my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo.
