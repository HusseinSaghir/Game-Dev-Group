Hi my is Kaleb. I am on my 2nd year of college so far and I am enjoying it. I am wanting to go into software development more on the business side. In my free time I enjoy playing video games like Final Fantasy and Monster Hunter. I have 5 total pets in my house. 2 dogs and 3 cats. I am hoping to have fun this year and looking to learn new things!
