Hello everyone, My name is Hussein Saghir, and if you remember me from the first day of class then you know that I currently work at Washtenaw Community College as a lab technician helping out the computer forensics courses and working on the data center in the TI building as well. I personally love my job because it allows me to help students learn the thing that I am most passionate about which is computer science but it also gives me great flexibility with time allowing me to follow my other passion which is programming games and apps. Over the winter break I took the time to start my own LLC so I can legitimize my work and make everything I do official so fingers crossed I make it big soon. My current greatest achievement at work is definitely the data center which I am excited to get set up soon so all the students can have an easier time taking these courses! On the side at the moment I am working on two videogames in completely different languages and frameworks because I guess I don't like for anything to be easy so I can't wait to add whatever other projects we need to do this semester on top of that! The last thing I can really mention is that I am honestly pretty excited to be doing some group work with people because I really do enjoy socializing and bouncing ideas back and forth so I hope we can all make some cool stuff together this year.
