Hi, I'm Nathan! I am 19 years old and going for a computer science major. The only language I'm super familiar with at the moment is Java, but I'm happy to learn and branch out. I have 2 cats who could possibly make an appearance on Zoom at some point, I'm surprised they haven't already. I'm Autistic so my interests change a lot, right now I'm really into Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Bistars, and House MD. I was recently peer pressured into watching Jujustu Kaisen and I really like it so far. I play a lot of the Binding of Isaac on and off, and I also really like Mewgenics so far.
