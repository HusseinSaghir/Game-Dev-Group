Past college education and/or current field of study. How far along are you in the college curriculum?
    I originally went to college studying biology/pre-med before pivoting myself into computer science. I studied for approximately 
    two years, then spent time gaining work experience in the tech field after teaching myself technical support fundamentals. 
    After spending roughly five years in the field, I began going back to school at night while working full-time so that I can move 
    towards software development

What are your hobbies or interests outside of class?
     I love dabbling in as many different things as possible in order to find out what I truly enjoy and am passionate about in life. 
     Historically, the ones that have stuck around are gaming, working out, art and music, and reading!

I mainly have experience with Java, Kotlin, and SQL. I have tinkered around in Unity, and a host of other programming languages. I have 
my past art experience and can create pixel art assets in Aseprite
